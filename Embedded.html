You can put your CSS rules into an HTML document using the <style> element. This tag is placed inside the <head>...</head> tags. Rules defined using this syntax will be applied to all the elements available in the document. Here is the generic syntax: 
<head> 
<style type="text/css" media="..."> 
Style Rules 
............ 
</style> 
</head>
